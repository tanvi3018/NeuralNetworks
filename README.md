# UCLA Neural Networks Solution

## Purpose

The UCLA Neural Networks Solution project focuses on building and evaluating neural network models for various predictive tasks. The project is designed to explore different architectures and techniques in neural networks, such as feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The primary goal is to develop models that can accurately predict outcomes based on complex datasets, leveraging the power of deep learning.

## How to RunTo run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    sh

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UCLA_Neural_Networks_Solution.git
cd UCLA_Neural_Networks_Solution

Install the Dependencies:
Ensure that you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or above). Install the necessary Python libraries using:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data:
Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and placed in the correct directory. If necessary, modify the data_loader.py script to load and preprocess your data according to the project's requirements.

Run the Main Script:
Execute the main script to train and evaluate the neural network models:

sh

python ucla_neural_networks_solution/main.py

View Results:
The script will output performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss, and may generate visualizations to help you understand the model's performance. Analyze these results to determine the effectiveness of the neural network models.

## Dependencies
This project depends on several Python libraries, which are specified in the requirements.txt file. Key dependencies include:

    tensorflow or pytorch: For building and training neural network models.
    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
    scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
    matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing results.
    seaborn: For creating advanced visualizations.

To install these dependencies, use the command:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
